12;"No experience is in itself a cause of our success or failure.
Nothing is actually determined by those influences.
We are not determined by our experiences, but by the meaning we give them.
We determine our own lives according to the meaning we give to those past experiences.";2
13;"We do not suffer from the shock of our experiences - the so-called trauma - but instead we make out of them whatever suits our purposes.";2
14;"If he thinks, “I can’t __ because I was abused by my parents”, it’s because it is his goal to think that way.
His real goal is “not going out.” He is creating anxiety and fear as his reasons to stay inside.
Why doesn’t he want to go out? So his parents will worry. So he can get all his parents’ attention.
If he takes one step out of the house, he’ll become part of a faceless mass whom no one pays attention to. He’ll end up average, or less than average. And no one will take special care of him.";2
15;"You did not fly into a rage and then start shouting. You got angry so that you could shout. To fulfill your goal of shouting, you created the emotion of anger.";2
16;"Anger is a tool that can be taken out as needed. It can be put away the moment the phone rings, and pulled out again after one hangs up.
Anger is a means to achieve a goal.
Personal anger is nothing but a tool for making others submit to you.
Anger is a form of communication, and that communication is possible without using anger.";2
17;"You are not controlled by emotion.
When you fly into a rage and shout at another person, it is “you as a whole” who is choosing to shout. Emotions don't somehow exist independently.
It is a lie to separate “I” from “emotion” and think, “It was the emotion that made me do it.”";2
18;"You are not controlled by the past.
The Freudian etiology that is typified by the trauma argument is determinism, and it is the road to nihilism.
Freudian etiology denies our free will and treats humans like machines.";2
19;"Personality is something that you choose for yourself.
External factors had a significant influence on that choice. But you chose this kind of self.
(Adlerian psychology’s view is that it happens around the age of ten.)";2
20;"You are afraid of being negated by other people.
You think that instead of getting entangled in such situations, it would be better if you just didn’t have relations with anyone.
Your goal is to not get hurt.";2
21;"There are three deaths.
The first is when the body ceases to function.
The second is when the body is consigned to the grave.
The third is that moment, sometime in the future, when your name is spoken for the last time.
Many people leave just as their loved ones arrive, since the loved ones were the only ones doing the remembering.
He waits with aching heart for his statues to fall.
And that is the curse of this room: since we live in the heads of those who remember us, we lose control of our lives and become who they want us to be.";3
22;"What we call God is actually a married couple. When they decided to create humans in their own image, they compromised and manufactured approximately equal numbers of both genders.
Certain nights when they're feeling liberal, each creates a member of the opposite sex, just to see what it's like.";3
23;"Your fantasies have cursed your realities.";3
24;"The end of death is the death of motivation.
Too much life, it turns out, is the opiate of the masses.
There is a noticeable decline in accomplishment.
People take more naps. There's no great rush.";3
25;"Your Creators are talented at just that: creation - but they're not involved with the observation and judgment of our actions, as we had previously supposed them to be.
The Creators watch none of the details as our lives unfold.
They could not care less.";3
26;"The you of eight years old has less in common than expected with the you of thirty-two and the you of sixty-four.
The eighteen-year-old you finds more in common with other eighteen-year-olds than with your seventy-three-year-old you.
The seventy-three-year-old you doesn't mind a bit, seeking out meaningful conversations with others of the same generation.
Beyond the name, the yous have little else in common.";3
27;"When you die, you are grieved by all the atoms of which you were composed.
They hung together for years, whether in sheets of skin or communities of spleen.
With your death they do not die. Instead, they part ways, moving off in their separate directions, mourning the loss of a special time they shared together, haunted by the feeling that they were once playing parts in something larger than themselves, something that had its own life, something they can hardly put a finger on.";3
28;"There is bitter competition among the gods.
Jealous rivalries abound because the stakes are so low; the gods are not large and powerful and they know it.
So they try their best to stand out and to be heard.
Some of the humans reach out to make cell phone contact with a single friend out of the innumerable hordes.
And gazing out over the steering wheel, each human feels the intensities of joy and grief as though his were the only real examples in the world.
Among all the creatures of creation, the gods favor us: we are the only ones who can empathize with their problems.";3
29;"Genes unwrap, proteins blossom, synapses rearrange.
All this is well below your awareness - you are merely carrying the brainbox with no acquaintance with what happens inside it.";3
30;"Being let into the secrets behind the scenes has little effect on our experience.
The secret codes of life - whether presented as a gift or a burden - go totally unappreciated.";3
